        , also known as a composite volcano, is a conical volcano built up by many layers (strata) of hardened lava and
        tephra.
        [1] Unlike shield volcanoes, stratovolcanoes are characterized by a steep profile with a summit crater and
        periodic intervals of
        explosive eruptions and effusive eruptions, although some have collapsed summit craters called calderas.
        The lava flowing from stratovolcanoes typically cools and solidifies before spreading far, due to high
        viscosity.
        The magma forming this lava is often felsic, having high to intermediate levels of silica (as in rhyolite,
        dacite, or andesite),
        with lesser amounts of less viscous mafic magma
        .[2] Extensive felsic lava flows are uncommon, but have traveled as far as 15 km (9 mi).[3]

        are common at subduction zones, forming chains and clusters along plate tectonic boundaries where oceanic crust
        is
        drawn under continental crust (continental arc volcanism, e.g. Cascade Range, Andes, Campania) or another
        oceanic
        plate (island arc volcanism, e.g. Japan, Philippines, Aleutian Islands). The magma forming stratovolcanoes rises
        when water trapped both in hydrated minerals and in the porous basalt rock of the upper oceanic crust is
        released
        into mantle rock of the asthenosphere above the sinking oceanic slab.[7]

        The release of water from hydrated minerals is termed
        "dewatering",and occurs at specific pressures and temperatures for each mineral, as the plate descends to
        greater depths.[8] The water freed
        In recorded history, explosive eruptions at subduction zone (convergent-boundary) volcanoes have posed the
        greatest hazard to
        civilizations.[15] Subduction-zone stratovolcanoes, such as Mount St. Helens, Mount Etna and
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Pinatubo" target="_blank">Mount Pinatubo </a>, typically erupt
        with explosive force because the magma is too viscous to allow easy escape of volcanic gases. As a consequence,
        the tremendous
        internal pressures of the trapped volcanic gases remain and intermingle in the pasty magma. Following the
        breaching of the vent
        and the opening of the crater.

        As per the above examples, while the Unzen eruptions have caused deaths and considerable local damage in the
        historic past,
        the impact of the June 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo was global. Slightly cooler-than-usual temperatures were
        recorded worldwide,
        with brilliant sunsets and intense sunrises attributed to the particulates; this eruption lofted particles high
        into the stratosphere.
        The aerosols that formed from the sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon dioxide (CO2), and other gases dispersed around
        the world.

        The SO2 mass in this cloud—about 22 million tons—combined with water (both of volcanic and atmospheric origin)
        formed droplets of
        sulfuric acid, blocking a portion of the sunlight from reaching the troposphere and ground. The cooling in some
        regions is thought
        to have been as much as 0.5 °C (0.9 °F).[15] An eruption the size of Mount Pinatubo tends to affect the weather
        for a few years;
        the material injected into the
        stratosphere gradually drops into the troposphere, where it is washed away by rain and cloud
        precipitation.[citation needed]
